# Introduction

[The Bitfinity EVM](https://bitfinity.network) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built on the
[Internet Computer Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/),
that provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform,
with low transaction costs for their users. In addition to the Bitfinity EVM, Bitfinity has developed the Neuro Bridge which allows users to transfer assets between the Ethereum network, the Internet Computer network, and the Bitfinity Network.
This bridge is built using canister smart contract technology on the Internet Computer, and the custody of assets is fully decentralised thanks to Chain-Key technology.
Bitfinity is backed by top VCs such as Polychain Capital Beacon Fund, ParaFi Capital, and Draft Ventures.

Thanks to Bitfinity’s EVM, Ethereum native applications can seamlessly be ported to the Internet Computer’s L2-like network that is built as a smart contract on the Internet Computer blockchain.
Developers may enjoy familiar Ethereum tooling when working with their Solidity smart contracts on the Bitfinity Network EVM.
The base fee cryptocurrency of Bitfinity is the Bitfinity Token (BFT), which provides a smooth experience for dApp users.

The features of the Internet Computer Protocol, such as delegated Proof-of-Useful-Work consensus mechanism and
[Chain Key cryptography](https://medium.com/dfinity/chain-key-technology-one-public-key-for-the-internet-computer-6a3644901e28),
allow unprecedented transaction speeds and scalability, as well as decentralised bridging in a fully Ethereum-compatible environment.

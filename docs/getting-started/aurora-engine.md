# Introduction

[EVMC](https://bitfinity.network) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built on the
[Internet Computer Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/),
that provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform,
with low transaction costs for their users. Besides the EVM, EVMC developed the Rainbow Bridge which allows users to transfer assets between Ethereum, Internet Computer, and EVMC.
EVMC is backed by top VCs such as Polychain Capital Beacon Fund, ParaFi Capital, Draft Ventures.

Thanks to EVMC’s EVM, Ethereum native applications can seamlessly be ported to Internet Computer’s L2-like network that is built as a smart contract on Internet Computer.
Developers may enjoy familiar Ethereum tooling when working with their Solidity smart contracts on EVMC.
The base fee of EVMC is ETH, which provides a smooth experience for dapps’ users.

Besides the EVM, EVMC developed the Rainbow Bridge which allows users to transfer assets between Ethereum, Internet Computer, and EVMC.
Several integrations of bridges from/to other networks have been launched as well, and more is coming!

The features of the Internet Computer Protocol, such as delegated Proof-of-Useful-Work consensus mechanism and
[Chain Key cryptography](https://medium.com/dfinity/chain-key-technology-one-public-key-for-the-internet-computer-6a3644901e28),
allow unprecedented transaction speeds and scalability in a fully Ethereum-compatible environment.

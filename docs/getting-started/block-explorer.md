## Public Explorer

[Bitfinity's block explorer](https://explorer.bitfinity.network/) is based on the [otterscan](https://github.com/wmitsuda/otterscan) project and provides real-time access to blockchain data (blocks, transactions, etc.). It interfaces with a custom [erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) node for continuous updates from Bitfinity.

The Block Explorer offers users and developers access to tools and network statistics for in-depth insights into Bitfinity's EVM. Users can view transactions, addresses, and blocks. Developers can access charts and statistics related to smart contract execution, collator data, specific token transfers, and a list of ERC-20 tokens on Bitfinity.

## Alternative Block Explorers

[DexGuru Block Explorer for  Bitfinity Testnet](https://bitfinity-test.dex.guru/) provides a familiar UI with data on transactions, blocks, account balances, and more. Developers can use it to verify smart contracts and debug transactions with interactive traces and logs visualization.

## Local Deployment

You can launch a standalone version of the block explorer for access to Bitfinity's blocks and transactions.

To do this, you will need to run a forked Erigon Node against the Bitfinity EVM. And once this has been stood up, you can run Otterscan or Bitfinity-Otterscan against this node.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### I'm an app developer. Why should I choose Bitfinity over other EVMs?

Bitfinity gives you access to new assets on Bitcoin, but with a familiar EVM development environment. You can use Bitcoin and BRC20  in Solidity smart-contracts.

Bitfinity is also high throughput and fast finality, finality is 1-2 seconds and throughput is comparable to Solana. 

### What are the basic performance metrics?

Bitfinity EVM can operate at more than 100 times the throughput of the Ethereum Mainnet.
And so Bitfinity helps to scale up the Bitcoin blockchain. Youc an also send Twinned/Wrapped Bitcoin on Bitfinity at lightning speeds.  

### How will transaction fees work?

The base fee token of Bitfinity is BITFNITY (BFT).
By leveraging the underlying low-cost capabilities of the IC, Bitfinity transactions will typically cost less than pennies.

DAO directed mechanisms that accumulate fees can channel a portion back to the projects running on Bitfinity!

### What does the high-level roadmap look like?

While the detailed Bitfinity roadmap is available on the [web site], in general, Bitfinity is set on its mission to integrate on-chain Bitcoin assets into the protocol, doing so in a seamless way.

### How will bridging tokens between Ethereum and Bitfinity work?

Very easy! You'll select the direction of transfer, the token you want to transfer, and the amount.
Your address on Bitfinity will be the same as your Ethereum address. The Bitfinity Bridge currently works with MetaMask.

### Which tokens will be supported?

Initially, chain-key versions of Bitcoin and BRC-20 tokens, as well as IC tokens. Later tokens from other ecosystems will be integrated, including Ethereum and Ethereum L2s. 


### How long will transfers take?

The Neuro Bridge technical architecture is designed to be “trustless”, meaning there’s no reliance on third-parties for authorizations.
Trustless transfers align with the ethos of decentralized finance, and rely on network confirmations to ensure finality.

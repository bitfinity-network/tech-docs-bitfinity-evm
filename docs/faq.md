# Frequently Asked Questions

## I'm an app developer. Why should I choose the Bitfinity Network EVM over other EVMs?

The Bitfinity Network EVM is governed by the decentralized BitfinityDAO, and leverages the unique underlying Internet Computer technologies to
align incentives of the network, product owners, and end users.
When you choose to deploy your app on the Bitfinity Network EVM, you’re partnering with a highly-capable and dedicated organization, and
building upon a technical foundation that will scale to meet all your future needs.

## What are the basic performance metrics?

The Bitfinity Network EVM can host more than 10 times the throughput of the Ethereum Mainnet.
There’s still a lot of room for a single-shard Bitfinity improvement, so we expect further throughput increases.

## How will transaction fees work?

The base fee token of the Bitfinity Network EVM is Bitfinity Token (BFT).
By leveraging the underlying low-cost capabilities of the Internet Computer Protocol, transactions on the Bitfinity Network EVM will typically cost pennies.
What’s particularly interesting is that the underlying fee model of the Internet Computer opens the door to innovative possibilities, such as
DAO directed mechanisms for channeling a portion of collected fees back to the projects running on the Bitfinity Network EVM!

## What does the high-level roadmap look like?

While the detailed roadmap from Bitfinity is available on the [web site], in general,
over the course of summer we plan to optimise the Bitfinity Network EVM and take care of the DAO formation and token development (if this is decided by the DAO).
In Autumn, we plan to deliver several major features, such as introduction of the Neuro bridge with the Internet Computer, and Mainnet launch.

## How do I get started with Bitfinity?

The Bitfinity Network EVM testnet has been deployed on the Internet Computer. It is currently under development and will be periodically upgraded. Developer alerts are published on [Discord].

## How will bridging tokens between Ethereum and the Bitfinity Network EVM work?

Very easy! You'll select the direction of transfer, the token you want to transfer, and the amount.
Your address on the Bitfinity Network EVM will be the same as your Ethereum address. The Bitfinity Bridge will initially work with MetaMask.
To access your tokens and apps on the Bitfinity Network EVM, you’ll need to add Bitfinity as an additional network to MetaMask. The Bitfinity Bridge will help you with this process.

## Which tokens will be supported?

Initially, BFT—the base fee token of Bitfinity—will be supported, followed by all SNS tokens, ckBTC, a select list of popular ERC-20 tokens, and then any arbitrary assets.

## How long will transfers take?

The Neuro Bridge technical architecture is designed to be “trustless”, meaning there’s no reliance on third-parties for authorizations.
Trustless transfers align with the ethos of decentralized finance but do require more time, given that network confirmations are required to ensure transaction finality.
There are, however, technical ways in which we can and will shorten transfer times in future updates to the Bitfinity Bridge.

## Will I be able to initiate multiple transfers in parallel?

Yes! Since confirmation of transfers can take a while, you’ll be able to initiate any number of concurrent transfers.

## I have a few more questions. Where can I get help?

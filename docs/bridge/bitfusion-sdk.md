The BitFusion Bridge SDK is an exciting open-source SDK that leverages Chain Key Technology to create novel solutions for decentralised bridging assets from any chain to the Bitfinity EVM.

This framework also includes a bridging widget for seamless integration into downstream applications, providing users with a near-native experience.

Some of the digital assets supported are:
* Bitcoin Runes, BRC20, and other tokens (in development)
    * [Top BRC-20 Tokens](https://coinranking.com/coins/brc-20)
    * [About BRC-20](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-brc-20-token-standard-an-overview)
* Internet Computer ICRC-2 tokens
    * [Wallet](https://wallet.bitfinity.network/)
    * [Token Lists Repo](https://github.com/bitfinity-network/token-lists)
* ERC-20 tokens (in development)
    * [ERC-20 Tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens)


The bridge uses a novel threshold signature scheme called [chain-key](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/chain-key-technology) to decentralise bridging. This means that the bridge is trustless up to f/n node failures.

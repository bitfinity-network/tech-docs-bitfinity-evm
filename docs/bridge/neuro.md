With the [Neuro Bridge](https://neurobridge.bitfinity.network/) you can trustlessly transfer between a number of ecosystems. Currently the bridge is still in development. 


Many of the tokens can be found from our [token lists page](https://bitfinity.network/tokens).

* Bitcoin BRC20 and other tokens (in development)

* Internet Computer ICRC-2 tokens
    * [Wallet](https://wallet.bitfinity.network/)
    * [Token Lists Repo](https://github.com/bitfinity-network/token-lists)
* ERC-20 tokens (in development)

The bridge uses a novel threshold signature scheme called [chain-key](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/chain-key-technology) to decentralise bridging. This means that the bridge is trustless up to f/n node failures.

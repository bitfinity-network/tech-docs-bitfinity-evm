# What is the Bitfinity EVM?

[Bitfinity] is a solution, that allows to execute Ethereum contracts in a more performant environment—Internet Computer blockchain, a modern layer-1 blockchain which is fast and scalable.
Bitfinity is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implemented as a smart contract on [Internet Computer Protocol]. We are here to help scale Ethereum ecosystem for developers to operate their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable, and future-safe platform, with low transaction costs for their users.

Bitfinity provides the Ethereum 1.0 development experience, with layer-2-like speed and scalability. If you are an Ethereum developer, **getting started on the Bitfinity EVM is as easy as changing the RPC endpoint you interact with**.

Bitfinity supports all tools available in the Ethereum ecosystem — [MetaMask], [Truffle], [Hardhat], [Remix], etc.

## Bitfinity Developer cheatsheet

### Gas fees

Transaction cost ~\$0.02

### Maximum gas per transaction (a monthly updated section)

The main issue we have on EVMC and we're constantly working on improving is the maximum gas per transaction limit.
The nature of the issue comes from the fact that the block time on Internet Computer is 1 second (for comparison it's 14 seconds on Ethereum).
Usually, the transaction must fit in a block.
There's no easy way to map Internet Computer Gas to Ethereum Gas.
If you see `"error": "wasm execution failed with error: FunctionCallError(HostError(GasLimitExceeded))"`, it means you've hit that limit.
It's often possible to optimise the contract to overcome the issue (reducing transaction batch sizes, optimising big transactions).
We're working hard on making the issue non-existent, but it's important to know it's present at the moment.
